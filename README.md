# GFDynamicLineChart
The line chart is able to receive living data. 

In my project, it will show the living sensor data from external device, for instance, Arduino.

BLE Framework I developed: https://github.com/YuanGao0317/GFBLEManager.git

/* An example of showing the data from Arduino project in iOS app. There are several previews to show what it is able to do. */
